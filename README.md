## joculatrix

I'm a recent college grad looking for work in programming! I mainly write projects either to
cement learning a new technology or concept, or to create new actually usable software to
solve personal preferences that steer me away from other existing tools.

```haskell
joculatrix :: Programmer
joculatrix = Programmer { name = "Sloane"
                        , pronouns = [ She, Her ]    -- (üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è)
                        , favLanguages =
                            [ Rust
                            , C
                            , Cpp
                            , Haskell                -- honorable mention <3
                            ]
                        , mainInterests =
                            [ SystemsProgramming
                            , Compilers
                            , FunctionalProgramming
                            , Theory
                            ]
                        , editor = Neovim
                        , platform = Linux
                        , currentMainProject = polypody
                        }
    where polypody = "https://github.com/joculatrix/polypody"
```
